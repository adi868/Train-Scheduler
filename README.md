# Train-Scheduler
This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. By using Firebase, we are able to host information on a server database which logs and saves data with permanence. This app is designed to retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js, and is coded to help users calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, including their arrival times, inputted information/frequency, and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
